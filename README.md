# rmk (r/mk) macropad

The rmk is a macropad that mimics the style of the r/mk stickers that are floating around out there.

I got the idea of using plate mount MX stabalizers to go with the Choc v2 switch from Gimbal in this post:
https://www.keebtalk.com/t/new-kailh-choc-v2-switches/8349/22

If you use MX switches, you will need to use a plate with plate mount stabs, or skip the stabs altogether.

The switch footprints are from this project: https://github.com/luke-schutt/Pi5Keyboard. They support Kailh Choc V1, V2, Gateron low profile, and MX switches

And finally, the schematic and wiring for the rp2040 was taken from this project: https://github.com/Sleepdealr/RP2040-designguide

## Stabalizer installation for Choc v2 switches

The installation of the stab wire is a bit tricky since it needs to go under the PCB.  This is the procedure I followed.

First, snap the stabalizer housing into the PCB without the stem or wire assembled.

Next, insert the stems into the housing.

Finally, you'll need to squeeze the wire in between the PCB and plastic "clip" so that it can be pushed into place.  You may need to lift the clip with a flat tool to create a gap, and apply a bit of force to get the wire in place.
